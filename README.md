# MiniBid
## Setup, Installation and Project Structure
First set up a new collection in mongodb called 'MiniBid' and get the ????LINK????. Fill the link's <password> and change 'myFisrtDatabase' to 'MiniBid;. This link will be used to connect the MiniBid application to the new mongodb collection.<br />
Before installing MiniBid make sure a ```.env``` file exists is the projects root directory. In ```.env``` create a variable ```DB_CONNECTOR``` and give it the mongodb link. Next create a variable ```TOKEN_SECRET``` and set it to a secret value, MiniBid will use this value when authenticating user tokens.<br />
<br />
To install and start MiniBid:
<br />
1. Navigate to project folder and install dependencies with: 
```
$ npm install
```
> This command will use the ```package.json``` file to install all of MiniBid's dependencies.
2. start MiniBid with:
  ```
  $ npm start
  ```
  > This will start MiniBid's server running on localhost, port 3000
