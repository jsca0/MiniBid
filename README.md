# MiniBid
## Setup, Installation and Project Structure
To setup and install MiniBid first make sure a ```.env``` file exists is the projects root directory, containing values for ```DB_CONNECTOR``` and ```TOKEN_SECRET```. MiniBid will use these values for connecting to the application’s database and authenticating user tokens.

1. Navigate to project folder and install dependencies with: 
```
$ npm install
```
> This command will use the ```package.json``` file to install all of MiniBid's dependencies.
