### Setup and Installation
First set up a new collection in mongodb called 'MiniBid' and get the ????LINK????. Fill the link's \<password> and change 'myFisrtDatabase' to 'MiniBid'. This link will be used to connect the MiniBid application to the new mongodb collection.

  Next make sure a ```.env``` file exists in MiniBid's root directory. In ```.env``` create a variable ```DB_CONNECTOR``` and give it the mongodb link. Then create a variable ```TOKEN_SECRET``` and set it to a secret value, MiniBid will use this value when authenticating user tokens.
  
  To install and start MiniBid:
  
1. Navigate to project folder and install dependencies with: 
```
$ npm install
```
> This command will use the ```package.json``` file to install all of MiniBid's dependencies.
2. Start MiniBid with:
  ```
  $ npm start
  ```
  > This will start MiniBid's server.
  Now MiniBid should be running on localhost port 3000. Clients can now send requests to MiniBid's API endpoints.
